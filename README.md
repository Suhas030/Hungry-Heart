# Hungry-Heart

Hey!

This is a web based restaurant website built using HTML,CSS,JS
To colect the data from forms we have not used a database but instead we have used a web software called Fromspree.

Formspree : This helps to collect data from the forms using post method and directly sends the data to the users mail.
link to site : https://formspree.io/
Make sure you create your account and get the collection link and set it up in the Order.html page
take help from the youtube if any...
